  "overall_description": "Assessing specified or unspecified functional requirements and characteristics of products, systems and services through investigation and testing.",
  "guidance_notes": "Functional testing verifies that systems, components and interfaces deliver specific functionality, operate as intended and meet user expectations. Risk-based test planning and execution is a key aspect, focusing on identifying and mitigating risks such as functionality errors, integration failures, edge case defects, data inconsistencies and non-compliance with requirements.\nActivities may include, but are not limited to:\n\ncollaborating with stakeholders to align testing with business requirements and objectives\ndesigning and adapting test cases based on requirements, including various scenarios, boundary values and edge cases\npreparing data and configuring environments to simulate realistic use cases\nexecuting tests to verify actual results align with expected outcomes\nlogging defects with detailed reproduction steps, prioritising issues and providing feedback for improvements\nanalysing results to identify patterns, assess quality and suggest system/testing enhancements\npromoting a shift-left approach by integrating functional testing early in the lifecycle for early issue detection\nmanaging, executing and automating tests, including regression and smoke tests, to improve efficiency and coverage\ndeveloping and maintaining scalable, reliable automated tests and frameworks to validate critical functionality and ensure continuous quality\nensuring compliance with industry standards, regulations and recognised good practices.",
  "level_descriptions": {
    "level_1": "Executes given manual functional test scripts under supervision to verify basic software capabilities.\nConfigures test environments, uses basic automated tools for functionality verification, records results and reports issues.",
    "level_2": "Assists in designing functional test cases and creating test scripts. \nSupports the preparation of test data for functional testing under supervision.\nConfigures test environments to reflect realistic use cases.\nExecutes and records manual and automated functional tests, analysing results and reporting on findings, issues and risks.",
    "level_3": "Designs detailed functional test cases and scripts, covering various scenarios and boundary values.\nActively participates in requirement and design reviews, refining test plans based on insights gained. \nUndertakes structured exploratory testing to investigate and verify functionality. \nPrepares test data, configures environments and automates repeatable tests. Executes tests, logs defects with detailed information and analyses results to assess system functionality.",
    "level_4": "Selects appropriate functional testing approaches, considering risk, criticality and complexity. \nDevelops, automates and executes comprehensive test plans and cases. \nConfigures environments to mirror real-world usage, collaborates with stakeholders to refine requirements and manages scalable automated testing frameworks. \nIdentifies and mitigates risks during testing, provides detailed analysis and reports on functional test activities and results, including work done by others.",
    "level_5": "Leads functional testing efforts across all development stages, ensuring alignment with functional requirements and focusing on risk-based prioritisation.\nProvides authoritative advice on testing methods, tools and frameworks.\nMonitors and improves test coverage, collaborates with teams to address challenges and ensures compliance with standards.\nLeads efforts to improve the efficiency and reliability of functional testing. Identifies improvements and contributes to organisational policies, standards and guidelines for functional testing.",
    "level_6": "Develops organisational policies, standards and guidelines for functional testing, ensuring they align with business strategy and incorporate a risk-based approach.\nPlans and leads complex testing initiatives, ensuring alignment with strategic objectives and incorporating a risk-based approach.\nManages risks and opportunities, coordinates with other testing activities and drives improvements in functional testing capabilities.\nPromotes a culture of quality in functional testing, driving adherence to organisational standards and proactive risk mitigation."
