This reflects the growing responsibility to identify, implement, and lead improvements across increasing scopes of influence.As professionals advance, their focus shifts from identifying opportunities for improvement in their own tasks to leading improvement initiatives across teams and the organisation. This progression includes enhancing practices at a personal level, supporting others in promoting a culture of continuous optimisation, and ensuring improvement efforts align with broader organisational goals. At higher levels, professionals take responsibility for embedding ongoing improvement strategies throughout the organisation, driving long-term impact.                                                                   |                                                                                                                                                                                            |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                                                                                                           |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

It also involves maintaining awareness of emerging practices and industry trends, and aligning learning initiatives with strategic business objectives.As professionals advance, their approach to learning and development evolves from focusing on personal skill enhancement to driving team and organisational development. Over time, they move from applying new knowledge to leading efforts that shape a culture of learning, aligning development initiatives with strategic goals. At senior levels, professionals not only inspire a learning culture but also ensure that the organisation has the necessary skills and capabilities to navigate industry changes and take advantage of opportunities. |                                                                                                                                                                                            |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                                                                                                           |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
