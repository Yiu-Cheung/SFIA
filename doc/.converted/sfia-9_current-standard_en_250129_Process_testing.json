  "overall_description": "Assessing documented and undocumented process flows within a product, system or service against business needs through investigation and testing.",
  "guidance_notes": "Process testing focuses on ensuring systems effectively support business processes, deliver value and meet user needs.\nIt involves identifying and mitigating risks such as inefficient or error-prone processes, unsupported user roles, restricted user actions, system complexity, inconsistent data handling and non-compliance with business requirements.\nActivities may include, but are not limited to:\n\ncollaborating with stakeholders to align testing with business requirements and objectives\ndesigning test cases that cover entire business workflows, including business rules, alternate paths and exception scenarios\nsetting up test environments that simulate real-world conditions, user roles and data flows\npreparing and managing test data to accurately support the scenarios being tested\nexecuting manual and automated tests to validate workflows, ensuring systems operate correctly across scenarios\nlogging and reporting findings with an emphasis on business process impact, providing insights and recommendations\nanalysing results to identify inefficiencies and areas for system and process enhancement\npromoting a shift-left approach by integrating process testing early in the lifecycle for early issue detection\ndeveloping and maintaining scalable automation frameworks\nensuring compliance with industry standards, regulations and recognised good practices.",
  "level_descriptions": {
    "level_1": "Executes given process test scripts under supervision to verify business workflows and user journeys. \nConfigures basic test environments to simulate business processes.\nUses standard testing tools for process validation, records results and reports issues.",
    "level_2": "Designs test cases and scripts to validate key business scenarios and workflows.\nSupports the preparation and management of test data under supervision to align with business processes Configures test environments to reflect real-world business processes.\nExecutes and records manual and automated process tests in line with test plans.\nAnalyses and reports on test activities, identifying issues and risks related to business process validation.",
    "level_3": "Designs process test cases and scripts that cover end-to-end business scenarios. \nActively participates in requirement and design reviews to refine test plans. Prepares and manages test data that accurately mirrors business processes. \nConfigures test environments, executes tests and addresses issues as they arise. Undertakes structured exploratory testing to assess alternative business flows. \nAutomates repeatable tests for efficiency. Analyses and reports on outcomes, focusing on impacts to business processes.",
    "level_4": "Selects and applies appropriate testing approaches based on business criticality, risk and process complexity. \nDevelops, automates and executes detailed test plans focusing on end-to-end process validation. Ensures automated test environments accurately simulate real business processes and workflows. \nCollaborates closely with stakeholders to refine business requirements and ensure full coverage. Identifies and mitigates risks throughout the testing process and addresses issues.\nProvides detailed analysis and reports on the impact of test results on business operations, including work done by others.",
    "level_5": "Leads process testing activities across all stages of development, ensuring alignment with business objectives and prioritising key workflows based on risk.\nEnsures test environments are robust and reflective of actual business operations.\nProvides expert advice on process testing, ensuring tests are effective and align with business needs.\nLeads efforts to improve the efficiency and reliability of process testing. Identifies gaps and risks and contributes to the development of policies and standards that support comprehensive and risk-based process testing.",
    "level_6": "Develops organisational policies, standards and guidelines for process testing, ensuring they align with business strategy and incorporate a risk-based approach.\nPlans and leads large-scale process testing initiatives, focusing on validating complex and critical processes.\nLeads efforts to optimise and innovate process testing methodologies, integrating them with overall business goals and risk management strategies.\nPromotes a culture of quality in process testing, driving adherence to organisational standards and proactive risk mitigation."
