  "guidance_notes": "A security vulnerability is a weakness, flaw or error found within a security system that has the potential to be leveraged by an external agent to compromise a secure system.\nActivities may include, but are not limited to:\n\nresearching new threats, attack vectors, risks and potential solutions\nresearching new or emerging cryptographic vulnerabilities \nreverse engineering hardware or software \napplying tools such as disassemblers, debuggers and fuzzers \nanalysing embedded devices\ndeveloping techniques and tools to analyse and expose vulnerabilities\ndesigning new vulnerability discovery techniques\nsharing mitigation techniques with relevant stakeholders.",
  "level_descriptions": {
    "level_2": "Assists with vulnerability research tasks under routine supervision.\nHelps document and report findings from vulnerability research activities.",
    "level_3": "Applies standard techniques and tools for vulnerability research. \nUses available resources to update knowledge of relevant specialism. \nParticipates in research communities. \nAnalyses and reports on activities and results.",
    "level_4": "Designs and executes complex vulnerability research activities. \nSpecifies requirements for environment, data, resources and tools to perform assessments. \nReviews test results and modifies tests if necessary. Creates reports to communicate methodology, findings and conclusions. Advises on deception methods by exploiting identified patterns. \nMakes an active contribution to research communities.",
    "level_5": "Plans and manages vulnerability research activities. \nMaintains a strong external network for vulnerability research. Gathers information on new and emerging threats and vulnerabilities. \nAssesses and documents the impacts and threats to the organisation. Creates reports and shares knowledge and insights with stakeholders. \nProvides expert advice and guidance to support the adoption of tools and techniques for vulnerability research. Contributes to the development of organisational policies, standards and guidelines for vulnerability research and assessment.",
    "level_6": "Plans and leads the organisation’s approach to vulnerability research.\nIdentifies new and emerging threats and vulnerabilities. Maintains a strong external network. Takes a leading part in external-facing professional activities to facilitate information gathering and set the scope of research work. \nEngages with and influences relevant stakeholders to communicate results of research and the required response. \nDevelops organisational policies and guidelines for monitoring emerging threats and vulnerabilities."
