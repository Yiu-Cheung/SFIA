  "level_descriptions": {
    "level_2": "Assists in monitoring service component capacity and performance under routine guidance and supervision.\nCollects and reports data on resource utilisation and capacity metrics. \nSupports the implementation of capacity management procedures and practices.",
    "level_3": "Monitors service component capacity and performance, identifying potential issues and escalating as necessary. \nApplies standard procedures to manage demand and capacity. \nParticipates in capacity modelling and forecasting activities, providing input and recommendations. \nSupports the implementation of capacity management tools and techniques.",
    "level_4": "Monitors service component capacity and initiates actions to resolve any shortfalls according to agreed procedures. \nApplies techniques to control the demand upon a particular resource or service. \nContributes to capacity modelling and planning using data-driven insights.\nSupports the design of service component capacity.",
    "level_5": "Manages capacity modelling and forecasting activities, using data-driven insights.\nProactively reviews information in conjunction with service level agreements to identify any capacity issues and specifies any required changes. Provides advice to support the design of service components, including designing in flexible and scalable capacity. \nWorks with business representatives to agree and implement short- and medium-term modifications to capacity. \nDrafts and maintains standards and procedures for service component capacity management. Ensures the correct implementation of standards and procedures.",
    "level_6": "Leads the development and implementation of policy and strategies for capacity and performance management to meet business needs. \nLeads capacity modelling and forecasting over the organisation’s planning or budgeting cycle using data-driven insights. Considers external factors and industry trends.\nEnsures policies and standards for capacity management are fit for purpose, current and correctly implemented. Drives continuous improvement in capacity management practices, focusing on cost-effectiveness and resource optimisation.\nReviews new business proposals and provides specialist advice on capacity issues."
