  "overall_description": "Assessing systems and services to evaluate performance, security, scalability and other non-functional qualities against requirements or expected standards.",
  "guidance_notes": "Non-functional testing assesses the behaviour of technology, system components, configurations and packages, ensuring they work together to support the system's operation. It focuses on identifying and mitigating risks related to system qualities and characteristics, such as performance, security, backup and recovery, availability, scalability, reliability, maintainability, monitoring, resource efficiency and compliance with technical standards.\nActivities may include, but are not limited to:\n\ncollaborating with stakeholders to clarify non-functional requirements and expectations\nsetting up test environments that mirror production conditions, simulating real-world usage\npreparing and managing test data to accurately represent necessary variety and volumes\ndesigning and executing stress, load, security and other non-functional tests\ntroubleshooting issues during testing, coordinating with technical teams to resolve problems\nparticipating in reviews to refine non-functional requirements, identifying risks and suggesting enhancements\nanalysing results to assess system performance, security and other key qualities, providing insights for improvement\npromoting a shift-left approach by integrating non-functional testing early in the lifecycle for early issue detection\nadapting testing strategies to suit various development methodologies\ndeveloping and maintaining automated tests, monitoring systems and frameworks to continuously assess system quality and performance\nensuring compliance with industry standards, regulations and recognised good practices.",
  "level_descriptions": {
    "level_1": "Executes given non-functional test scripts under supervision, focusing on system qualities and characteristics such as performance.\nSets up basic test environments and uses standard tools to execute prescribed tests.\nRecords results and reports issues.",
    "level_2": "Assists in designing non-functional test cases and creating test scripts. \nSupports the preparation of test data for non-functional testing under supervision. Configures test environments. Executes both manual and automated non-functional testing.\nImplements appropriate test tools based on given non-functional requirements or specifications. Defines test conditions for given non-functional requirements. \nAnalyses and reports on test activities, results, issues and risks.",
    "level_3": "Designs non-functional test cases and scripts, mapping to pre-set criteria for system qualities and characteristics.\nPrepares and manages test data to reflect real-world scenarios. Configures test environments, collaborates with stakeholders to clarify requirements and automates repeatable tests. \nParticipates in requirement reviews to refine comprehensive test plans. Undertakes exploratory tests to investigate unusual behaviours. \nExecutes tests, troubleshooting issues as they arise. Analyses and reports on test activities, providing thorough coverage of non-functional attributes.",
    "level_4": "Selects suitable non-functional testing approaches, considering system criticality and complexity. \nDevelops, automates and executes test plans for end-to-end system attributes. Configures and manages complex, test environments, ensuring alignment with production conditions. \nApplies risk-based strategies to prioritise test efforts and collaborates across teams to ensure comprehensive automated test coverage. Troubleshoots issues in real-time, ensuring prompt resolution. \nAnalyses and reports on test activities, results and risks, including the work of others.",
    "level_5": "Plans and drives non-functional testing across all stages, ensuring alignment with requirements and prioritising risk-based strategies. \nProvides expert advice on non-functional  methods, tools and frameworks. Leads the setup and maintenance of advanced test environments. \nMonitors the application of testing standards, ensuring they reflect real-world conditions. Troubleshoots and resolves complex issues, working closely with stakeholders.\nLeads efforts to improve the efficiency and reliability of non-functional testing. Identifies improvements and contributes to organisational policies, standards and guidelines for non-functional testing.",
    "level_6": "Develops organisational policies, standards and guidelines for non-functional testing, ensuring they align with business strategy and incorporate a risk-based approach.\nPlans and leads strategic, complex testing activities, ensuring they align with overall system quality goals. Manages risks and opportunities, coordinating with other types of testing.\nDevelops organisational capabilities to address complex quality validation challenges. Drives continuous automation and improvements in test environments.\nPromotes a culture of quality in non-functional testing, driving adherence to organisational standards and proactive risk mitigation."
